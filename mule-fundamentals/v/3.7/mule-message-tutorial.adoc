This tutorial walks you through how you can access information about the content, data structure, and environment of Mule Messages using various tools in Anypoint Studio and the Mule server. It also teaches you how to access that information within your applications with *Mule Expression Language (MEL)*. If you completed the link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/basic-studio-tutorial[Basic Studio Tutorial] or the link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/content-based-routing-tutorial[Content-Based Routing Tutorial], you have already encountered and used some MEL expressions. Work through this tutorial to orient yourself further to MEL and how you can use it within your Mule applications to extract information from your message, set or manipulate values, or perform operations based on data extracted from the message at runtime.

After following the guided steps in this tutorial, you should be able to apply what you have learned to access information about the Mule message as it moves through your own applications and create MEL expressions based on this information.

== Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have downloaded and installed link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[Anypoint Studio]. If you do not have any previous experience with Eclipse or an Eclipse-based IDE, review the brief introduction to the link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-studio-essentials[Anypoint Studio interface] or complete the link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/basic-studio-tutorial[Basic Studio Tutorial]. 

If you are not using Studio, refer to the XML tabs within the following sections, which are also relevant for users of the standalone runtime: <<Using the Logger>> and Selecting Data from the Mule Message and its Environment with MEL. 

This tutorial also assumes that you have a basic understanding of the link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/mule-message-structure[Mule message structure].

== Goals

In this tutorial, your goals are to:

. Get familiar with the various ways you can access information about a Mule message and its environment in Anypoint Studio.
. Select specific data from your message, application, Mule instance, and server using MEL expressions and log that data to the console.
. Assign a variable.
. _(Optional)_ Apply your knowledge to an extra credit challenge.

== Accessing Information about your Mule Messages

Before you can effectively access and manipulate your message using Mule Expression Language, you need to know what your message contains at different stages as it moves through your flow. What is the payload? What is its data type? What inbound properties are available on the message? What flow or session variables are set on the message? What are the message's outbound properties? There are various ways to access all this information – and more – about your message and its environment. This section of the tutorial walks you through each of the following tools:

* <<Using the Logger>>
* <<Using Autocomplete>>
* <<Using DataSense Explorer>>
* <<Using Visual Debugger>>
* <<Using the Mule Expression Evaluator>>

=== Using the Logger

One reliable and fast way to get a wealth of information about your message is to log your message to the console or a log file and examine the results. When using Mule Standalone, this is the only means you have to view the message (or parts of it) as it transitions the flow; when using Anypoint Studio, this document covers below some more flexible and practical ways to access this information.

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Studio Visual Editor"]
....
. Launch Anypoint Studio and create a new Mule Project. If you need more directions on launching Studio and creating a project, refer to the link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/basic-studio-tutorial[Basic Studio Tutorial]. 
. Model a flow on the canvas of the visual editor, as shown.
+
image:basic+flow.png[basic+flow]
+
. Configure your HTTP connector so that the *path* is */* and that it has a connector configuration element with *Host* set to *localhost* and *Port* set to *8081*.
. Save and then run your project by selecting your project in the package explorer and selecting *Run As* > *Mule Application*.
. Select the Console tab and wait for the indication that Mule is up and kicking. 
. Open a browser and point it to `http://localhost:8081`.
. Observe that, by default, the logger logs all the information about the Mule message, except for the payload.
+
[INFO]
====
Why isn't the payload included in this log output?

By design, the logger's default output is all information about the Mule message except for the payload. The payload is not included because it might be very verbose or in an unreadable format. Instead, this default output includes information about the payload type, which is very useful information in a situation where you are interested in seeing a collection of all the key information about the message and its fields.
Of course, logging the payload is also very easy to do: simply set the logger message to `#[message.payload]`.
====
+
image:log+output.png[log+output]
+
. The key-value pairs displayed by the logger correspond to the *fields* of the message and the *properties* and *variables* that you can access with a Mule expression at this point in the flow. In this example, the log output provides the names and values of a long list of inbound properties set by the HTTP connector through which this message arrived into the flow. So, you could use this information to write a MEL expression to select one of these inbound properties, like this:
+
`#[message.inboundProperties.'http.method']`
+
If you feed Mule this expression in some message processor later in your flow, Mule evaluates that expression at runtime and returns a value of GET.
+
You can log the Mule message to the console at any time in an application to give you quick access to this summary of data about the message and its properties and variables.

....
[tab,title="Mule Standalone"]
....

If you aren't using Anypoint Studio to develop with Mule, you still need to access information about your message in order to work with it using MEL. Using the logger component to surface information at various points in your flows. You can configure the logger message to produce very specific information, or leave it unconfigured to log the entire message.

. Create a Mule application configuration file, as shown.
+
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 
<mule xmlns:http="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/http" xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core" xmlns:doc="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/documentation"

        <logger level="ERROR" doc:name="Logger"/>
    </flow>
</mule>
----

. Save and deploy your application to your Mule standalone server, using your preferred method.
. Watch your console for indication that your application has deployed successfully.
+
image:deploy-success.png[deploy-success]
+
. Point a browser to` http://localhost:8081`.
. Navigate to your `$MULE_HOME/logs` folder and open the .log file associated with this application.
. Observe the log output produced by the message that you sent via your browser.
+
[INFO]
====
Why isn't the payload included in this log output?

By design, the logger's default output is all information about the Mule message except for the payload. The payload is not included because it might be very verbose or in a not particularly readable format. Instead, this default output includes information about the payload type, which is very useful information in a situation where you are interested in seeing a collection of all the key information about the message and its fields.

Of course, logging the payload is also very easy to do: simply set the logger message to +
`#[message.payload]`
====
+
image:log+output.png[log+output]
+
. The key-value pairs displayed by the logger correspond to the attributes of the message context object and the properties and variables that you could access with a Mule expression at this point in the flow. In this example, the log output provides the names of all the inbound properties that you can access, including their current values. So, you could use this information to write a MEL expression to select one of these inbound properties, like this:
+
`#[message.inboundProperties.'http.method']`
+
 If you give Mule this expression in some message processor later in your flow, Mule evaluates that expression at runtime and returns a value of GET.

You can log the Mule message at any time in an application to give you quick access to this summary of data about the message and its properties and variables.
....
------

=== Using Autocomplete

[NOTE]
Note that the autocomplete functionality described here works in the *Visual Editor only*. Although Studio's XML tab does offer some autocomplete options, the suggestions there are limited by Eclipse and are not based on DataSense or Mule Expression Language.

If you're looking for a specific field, property, or variable and you want to check if it exists in scope as you configure a message processor, you can trigger Studio's autocomplete feature. Opening autocomplete in Studio's Visual Editor prompts Mule to suggest possible MEL objects, fields, and functions based on what metadata is available in the flow at that point. 

In this section, you use a MEL expression to access a particular inbound property of the message: the HTTP request and use that value to create a flow variable on the message.

. Add a Variable Transformer to your flow, before the Logger, as shown.
+
image:basic+flow+2.png[basic+flow+2]
+
Open the properties editor of your new variable transformer and select the *Set Variable* option. Notice that the *Value* fields contain *#[]*, hinting this field accept MEL expressions (most fields accept mule expressions as well, including the *Name* field too).
+
image:variable.png[variable]
+
. For this example, there's no need to use an expression to define the flow variable name, so enter `path`.
. Place your cursor inside the brackets in the *Value* field, then press *CTRL + Spacebar* to trigger autocomplete.
+
image:set-var-auto.png[set-var-auto]
+
. Studio displays a list of context objects and other operands and functions, based on which are most commonly used in Mule. Select *message*, then add a period.
+
image:set-var-exp2.png[set-var-exp2]
+
. Studio now displays a list of available fields and properties of the context object message. Note the red X next to the field indicates that, as it is currently written, the expression is not well-formed. Select *inboundProperties* and note how the red X immediately disappears. The expression `#[message.inboundProperties]` is technically complete. Mule evaluates this and returns a map of all inbound properties on the message.
. After inboundProperties, add another period to trigger autocomplete again. This time, select `http.request.path`, as shown below:
+
image:mel-tutorial-set-variable.png[mel-tutorial-set-variable]
+
You have now configured the variable transformer to set a flow variable called path with a value that Mule evaluates at runtime based on this MEL expression:
+
[source,code]
----
#[message.inboundProperties.'http.request.path']
----

=== Using DataSense Explorer

You have access to an additional view in Studio immediately to the right of your message processor properties editor tab called the *DataSense Explorer*. As you select building blocks on your canvas and view the properties editor in the console, the DataSense Explorer displays information about your payload, properties, and variables, as well as their data types as your message enters that building block and as it exits. Click the *In* and *Out* buttons to observe how the processing in the selected building block affects the Mule message. 

image:metadata+in.png[metadata+in]

*Note* that the path variable appears in the Out view, reflecting what you have configured within this message processor.

image:metadata+out.png[metadata+out]

[NOTE]
====
*Not seeing a change in the output?*

In order to refresh the view in the DataSense Explorer, you may need to click out of the properties editor, then click the building block again to return to it.
====

For more information on how you can use the information in this panel during design time, see Using the DataSense Explorer.

=== Using Visual Debugger

For the most comprehensive, layered view of your message, run your application in Debug mode. 

. If your application is still running, stop it by clicking the red square in the console.
. Right-click on the *Logger* component on your canvas, then select *Toggle Breakpoint*. Do the same for the Variable Transformer.
+
image:breakpoints.png[breakpoints]
+
. Click *Mule Debug* in the upper left corner of the Studio application to switch to the Mule Debug perspective.
+
image:debug+view.png[debug+view]
+
. Select your project in the package explorer and selecting *Debug As* > *Mule Application*. 
. Studio automatically switches you to the Mule Debugger View tab once the application is started. Send your browser to `http://localhost:8081/hello?language=english` to trigger a new message.
. Mule catches the message and pauses it at the first breakpoint in your flow. On the canvas, the location of your message is highlighted, as shown.
+
image:debugging+flow.png[debugging+flow]
+
. Below your canvas, the Mule Debugger View displays two panels of information about your message as it hits this breakpoint in the flow. The panel on the left lists information about the payload and the immediate message context in a tree structure. The panel on the right lists all available metadata at this point in the flow. The right panel is organized into four separate tabs that represent the four metadata scopes that you can access and manipulate on your message: inbound properties, outbound properties, flow variables, and session variables.
+
image:debugger+con+globitos.png[debugger+con+globitos]
+
. Browse through the tree structure under Message in the left panel and through the four tabs in the right panel and observe the detailed information about the message that is available. For each named object or field, the Debugger View displays the current value and the data type. For example, open the *Message* node in the left panel and note that your payload type is `org.mule.transport.NullPayload`. 
. In the right panel, note that your http.query.params are structured as an `org.mule.module.http.internal.ParameterMap`. Click the *http.query.params* node to expand it, then expand the first item beneath it. Observe that each parameter is itemized with its index number, and each of those can be expanded further to expose the key and value within each map entry. The data type column reveals the underlying data structure for each level of information.
+
image:exloring+query+params.png[exloring+query+params]
+
. Switch to the *Variables* tab in this panel. Note that because the breakpoint stops the message _before_ the processing inside that message processor occurs, there are no variables set on the message yet, so this panel is empty.
. Press F8 or click the Resume icon (image:Resume+icon.png[Resume+icon]) to prompt Mule to unpause processing and continue to the next breakpoint, which, in this example, is the Logger. Note that the Variables tab now includes one entry.
+
image:Debug-newvariable.png[Debug-newvariable]
+
. The Debugger display informs you that you now have access to the flow variable that was set by the Variable Transformer in the previous step in the flow, which was configured to resolve the following expression and store the result in the flow variable named `path`:
+
[source,code]
----
#[message.inboundProperties.'http.request.path']
----
+
As the Debugger demonstrates, the MEL expression has done what you asked it to: access the message's inbound property `http.request.path` and return its value – in this case, "/hello". The Debugger tells you the name of the variable, the current value, and the data type.
+
[TIP]
====
To see a representation of a MEL expression that would access the flow variable, session variable, or outbound property, click its value, and change it to something else, keeping the quotes intact, as shown. 

image:Debug-var-edit.png[Debug-var-edit]

This feature of Debugger allows you the flexibility to troubleshoot issues later in your flow that might rely on values earlier in the flow, but it is also helpful if you are learning MEL and need some hints about how to form expressions to correctly access a particular part of your message.

Note that this only works for mutable metadata. Because inbound properties are immutable (such as `http.request.path`), you cannot edit them in the Debugger.
====

=== Using the Mule Expression Evaluator

The most direct and dynamic way of exploring which MEL expressions resolve as you expect them to is to use the Mule Expression Evaluator within the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/studio-visual-debugger[Visual Debugger]. You can access the Mule Expression Evaluator while running in Debug mode, after having sent a message and paused it at a breakpoint in your flow.

. With your flow paused at your Logger breakpoint, open the Mule Expression Evaluator by clicking the image:x+plus+y.png[x+plus+y] icon. In the yellow box that opens, you can test out any MEL expression. Mule immediately evaluates the expression, relative to the breakpoint in your flow where your message is currently paused, and either returns a value or throws an exception.
. Try out the following MEL expressions in the Mule Expression Evaluator and note the results:
+
[width="100%",cols=",",options="header"]
|===
|Expression |Value Returned |Type |Notes
|*`#[message.payload]`* |`{NullPayload}` |org.mule.transport.NullPayload |To have a payload, your incoming request should add a body
|*`#[message.payload == null]`* |`true` |java.lang.Boolean |This confirms that your payload is null.
|*`#[flowVars.path]`* |`/hello` |java.lang.String |This is the value and type of the flow variable that you recently set.
|*`#[flowVars]`* |`{path =/hello}` |org.mule.el.context.
MessagePropertyMapContext |This expression asks Mule to return a map with all flow variables on the message. In this case there is only one entry. Note that you can expand the results.
|*`#[sessionVars.svpath = 'inbound path is' + flowVars.path]`* |`inbound path is /hello` |java.lang.String |This expression creates a session variable called svpath and assigns it a value by concatenating the string 'inbound path is ' with the current value of the flow variable path
|*`#[server.dateTime]`* |`2014-12-11T13:16:`

`45.448-03:00` |org.mule.el.datetime.DateTime |This expression calls the dateTime function and returns the date in the default format.
|*`#[UUID.randomUUID()]`* |`6ec58883-a1c2-4648-b0df-abcd849534a1` |java.util.UUID |This expression generates a random UUID.
|*`#[System.out.println('Hello, World!')]`* |`null` |null |This expression doesn't resolve to a value, hence the null value returned by the expression evaluator. However, it does result in Hello, World! being printed to your console.
|*`#[2 + 2]`* |`4` |java.lang.Integer |MEL can also do math.
|*`#[message.payload = ('fubar' contains 'bar') ? 'Yes!' : 'Nope!']`* |`Yes!` |java.lang.String |This conditional assignment statement evaluates the comparison in the parentheses, then selects the first value after the question mark if true and the second value if false, then deposits that value into the target (in this case, the payload.)
|===

For more ideas on MEL expressions to test out in the Mule Expression Evaluator, refer to the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/mule-expression-language-basic-syntax[syntax guide] or borrow some from the collection of introductory link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/mule-expression-language-examples[MEL examples].

== Selecting Data from Mule Messages and Their Environment with MEL

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Studio Visual Editor"]
....
Now that you're familiar with how to access information about your message and its environment, try logging some other basic data to the console with this logger message:

`#[app.name] running on Mule version #[mule.version] on #[server.userName] arrived with the path #[flowVars.path]`

. Open your logger and enter this text into the *Message* field of the logger, as shown.
+
image:logger-config-mel.png[logger-config-mel]
+
. Save and run your project.
. Point your browser to `http://localhost:8081/Aaron`, but replace "Aaron" with your own name.
. Observe the results in your console.
+
`INFO  2014-12-12 14:40:02,393 [[mel_test].connector.http.mule.default.receiver.02] org.mule.api.processor.LoggerMessageProcessor: mel_test running on Mule version 3.7.3 on AaronMacbook arrived with the path /Aaron`

Your results can vary depending on these factors:

* What you named your mule project
* What runtime version you are using
* The name of your computer
* The name you typed into your browser
....
[tab,title="Mule Standalone"]
....
In your existing project that you created in the <<Using the Logger>> section,

. Modify your flow to include a set-variable element with the name `path` and a value of  +
`#[message.inboundProperties.'http.request.path']` 
+
[source, xml]
----
<set-variable name=path value="#[message.inboundProperties.'http.request.path']"/>
----
. Configure your logger element with the following message: +
`#[app.name] running on Mule version #[mule.version] on #[server.userName] arrived with the path #[flowVars.path]`
+
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<logger level="INFO" message="#[app.name] running on Mule version #[mule.version] on #[server.userName] arrived with the path #[flowVars['path']]"/>
----
+
``
. Save and run your revised project.
. Point your browser to http://localhost:8081/Aaron, or replace "Aaron" with your own name.
. Navigate to your `$MULE_HOME/logs` folder and open the .log file associated with this application.
. Observe the log output produced by the message that you sent via your browser.

`org.mule.api.processor.LoggerMessageProcessor: mel_test running on Mule version 3.6.0 on AaronMacbook arrived with the path /Aaron`

Your results can vary depending on these factors:

* what you named your mule project
* what runtime version you are using
* the name of your computer
* the name you typed into your browser
....

== Extra Credit

Now that you know your way around the Mule message and you've seen some examples of how to use MEL to access information from it, try applying your knowledge to an extra task.

Using MEL, you can do more than just access data, you can also manipulate the message payload, attachments, variables, and outbound properties. (Because a message's inbound properties are set by the message source, you can't change those.)

Create a new Mule project that:

. Sets the following map as the message payload: ['favorite_animal':'mule','favorite_color':'blue','favorite_day':'today'].
. Uses a MEL expression to change the value of your favorite day from the string 'today' to the day of the week that it is as you read this tutorial, without altering the rest of the payload.
. Logs the resulting payload to the console in a human-readable format.

To achieve this you need to write three total MEL expressions in three different message processors. The first expression needs to set the payload to a map, the second needs to both access the correct map key=value pair and replace the value of that item with a dynamically evaluated value, and the third needs to log the resulting payload.

Don't hesitate to use the tools in Anypoint Studio to help you work out how to form these expressions. Use the hints below if you need help.

=== Hints and Answers

image:hints.png[hints] *Hints*

How do I set that map as my payload?
// hide
[TIP]
Use a *Set Payload* transformer and set the value to +
`#[['favorite_animal':'mule','favorite_color':'blue','favorite_day':'today']]`
Be sure to check your brackets!


Which message processor allows me to use MEL to manipulate one part of my payload while leaving the rest intact?
// hide
[TIP]
Use an *Expression Component* in your flow to manipulate parts of the Mule message without replacing the entire payload. Note that an expression component and expression transformer look very similar, but the latter always sets the value of the expression as the new payload of the message, so you don't want that in this case.

How do I form the part of the expression that accesses just the part of the map that I want?

// hide
[TIP]
Include `message.payload.favorite_day` in a MEL expression to access the value of the 'favorite_day' map item.

How do I form the part of the expression that calculates the day of the week?
// hide
[TIP]
Use the server.dateTime function, then format the result by calling the format() method, passing the argument 'EEEE'. Based on http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html[SimpleDateFormat], this returns a string in the form of the day of the week.

Help! I ran my application and it returns some kind of file instead of logging to the console.
// hide
[TIP]
Try running your application in Debug Mode with breakpoints on your message processors. What payload type do you observe? Is that payload type serializable? If it is, Mule is converting your payload to a byte array per its default behavior. In this case, you want a nice readable string instead, so you need to add an additional message processor after your expression component to change your data type. Browse through the transformers drawer in the palette to find the appropriate one that does the trick.

[TIP]
====
View the answer, including explanation of steps and complete code

There is more than one way to achieve the goals outlined above, but here is the fastest way:

. Create a new Mule project. +
Drag an HTTP connector onto the canvas. Create a configuration element for it with host set to *localhost* and port set to **8081**. Then, back in the connector set the path to /.
. Add a Set Payload transformer after the HTTP connector. Set the value to +
`#[['favorite_animal':'mule','favorite_color':'blue','favorite_day':'today']]`
. Add an Expression Component after the Set Payload. In the Expression field, enter  +
`message.payload.favorite_day = server.dateTime.format('EEEE')`
+
image:expression-mel.png[expression-mel]

Note that you do not need to put #[] around the statement, because the expression component adds the expression syntax automatically. In XML, the expression component looks like this:


[source, xml, linenums]
----
<expression-component doc:name="Expression"><![CDATA[message.payload.favorite_day = server.dateTime.format('EEEE')]]></expression-component>
----

The left side of the expression accesses the 'favorite_day' item in your map. The right side of the expression calculates the day of the week using a server.dateTime expression. The equals sign assigns the day of the week to the 'favorite_day' map item.
. Add an Object to String transformer after the Expression Component. Because the payload is serializable, Mule automatically converts it to a bytearray, unless otherwise instructed. In this case, you want human-readable output. Adding this transformer produces a string.
. Add a logger and set the message to `#[message.payload]` to log the new payload.
. Your flow should now look like this.

image:mel-ec-flow.png[mel-ec-flow]

. Save your project, then run it locally.
. Go to a browser and request `http://localhost:8081`. Your browser should print a map similar to the following: `{favorite_animal=mule, favorite_color=blue, favorite_day=Wednesday}`
