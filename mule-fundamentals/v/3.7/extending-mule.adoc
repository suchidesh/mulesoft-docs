= Extending Mule
:keywords: connectors, devkit, open source, develop, extend, customize

Out of the box, Mule comes with a healthy suite of pre-packaged features and functionality. In particular, Anypoint Studio comes bundled with two Enterprise trial runtimes and several Anypoint Connectors. Robust as it is, you may wish to extend Mule's capabilities beyond what you get out of the box.

== Build Customized Functionality 

If you find that your integration development team regularly requires functionality not included with Mule out of the box, you can make use of the extensive link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.7[Anypoint Connector DevKit] to build your own extensions. 

Use DevKit to:

* Build your own *connectors* to use in Mule applications
* Build your own *modules* that you can add to an instance of Studio
* Extend an existing Mule element to *customize* it to your needs
