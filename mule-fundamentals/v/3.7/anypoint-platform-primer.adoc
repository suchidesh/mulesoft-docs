Welcome to the documentation for MuleSoft's Anypoint Platform. Follow the links below to learn more about the platform components and underlying concepts. 

== Anypoint Platform

Anypoint Platform is a complete integration platform for SOA, REST, SaaS integration, and APIs. Anypoint Platform provides a comprehensive set of tools and services, which includes Anypoint Studio, Mule ESB, and Anypoint Platform's online access point. Anypoint Platform's access point includes access to Runtime Manager, API development tools, and more.

Anypoint Platform helps you achieve your integration goals:

* Integrate SaaS and on-premises applications
* Modernize legacy services
* Orchestrate business processes and services
* Design and publish APIs for end customers, B2B, or mobile - APIs can be in SOA or REST
* Create API proxies to separate implementation from orchestration
* Engage consumers of your API
* Govern APIs with runtime policies

There are several entry-points to the platform, depending on your business case. Explore the options below.

* <<Anypoint Platform for APIs>>
* <<Anypoint Platform for SaaS Integration>>
* <<Anypoint Platform for SOA>>

=== Anypoint Platform for APIs

The *Anypoint Platform for APIs* facilitates the entire API lifecycle, from design to management to publishing.

Use *API Designer* a web based tool to help you quickly design RESTful APIs. Once you’ve designed an API, you or other developers can use the *API Notebook* to explore the API, test it, and iteratively improve it.

Once you are happy with the design of your API, you can build it with APIkit, open-source tooling included in *Anypoint  Studio*. *APIkit* is a simple, easy-to-use framework that automatically generates an integration structure for your API, so you can hook into your services and data sources.

Deploy your API to the *API Gateway*, a dedicated orchestration layer where you can deploy Mule-based APIs or proxies of already-built APIs. Once your API is running, you can use *Anypoint API Manager* as your single point of management for all your APIs to control access, enforce SLAs, and monitor users and traffic to keep APIs and services running at peak performance. Developers building applications that use your API can register for access on a dedicated *API Portal* page, where they can discover, test out, and access documentation for your API.

==== How to Get Started

. Learn how to get started designing your API with API Designer link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-intro-create[here].
. Next, follow link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-build[this guide] to implement your API in Anypoint Studio.
. To get started managing APIs, jump to the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-manage[Manage your API walkthrough].

=== Anypoint Platform for SaaS Integration

Mule's integration platform helps you connect applications, orchestrate business processes, and publish new services and APIs.

Design your integrations with *Anypoint Studio*, Anypoint Platform's graphical design environment. With Studio, you can assemble your integration flow using the intuitive drag-and-drop tool or using XML. Use *link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector&sortBy=name[Anypoint Connectors]* to connect to a large number of SaaS and on-premises applications, or connect through standard protocols such as web services, HTTP, or FTP.

Run your integrations either in the cloud via *CloudHub* or on-premises via an *Mule ESB* standalone instance. CloudHub is an integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) which provides everything you need in order to run your integrations in the cloud. With Mule ESB, you can deploy your integrations to any data center – on premises or in the cloud. You can manage both your apps on premises and those in the cloud. You can manage both your apps on premises and your apps in the cloud through the same interface, the *Runtime Manager* console, available in your link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] account.

==== How to Get Started

. To get started building integrations with Anypoint Studio, you can work through the rest of Mule Fundamentals, starting with link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/begin-with-the-basics[Begin with the Basics].
. Interested in checking out CloudHub first? Follow the link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] guide.

=== Anypoint Platform for SOA

*Mule ESB* is a Java-based enterprise service bus (ESB) and integration platform that allows you to quickly and easily connect applications to exchange data following the service-oriented architecture (SOA) methodology. Mule enables easy integration of existing systems, regardless of the different technologies that the applications use, including JMS, Web Services, Java-based databases, HTTP, and more.

Mule's lightweight, open-source middleware provides comprehensive application integration. The Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) at Mule’s core facilitates connections within an organization as well as secure external connections to web-based APIs and other cloud resources via link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors]. Build applications using link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-studio-essentials[Anypoint Studio], leveraging pre-packaged building blocks designed to “plug in” to the standardized interface provided by the Mule service bus. Mule runtimes allow you to deploy and run multiple applications simultaneously, you can launch the runtime standalone, or manage and monitor it via link:/runtime-manager[Runtime Manager] or the link:/mule-management-console[Mule Management Console]. Through both managing platforms you can deploy your applications not only to single servers, but to server groups and high availability clusters.

[WARNING]
You may be thinking, "So, is Mule similar to an application server like JBoss or Tomcat?" Although there is an overlap in functionality, Mule differs significantly from a web application server. link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/mule-versus-web-application-server[Find out how].
